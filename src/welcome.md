# Welcome

This notebook contains my personal notes for CS7646: Machine Learning for
Trading, offered at the Georgia Institute of Technology. A summary of the course
follows:

> This course introduces students to the real world challenges of implementing
machine learning based trading strategies including the algorithmic steps from
information gathering to market orders. The focus is on how to apply
probabilistic machine learning approaches to trading decisions. We consider
statistical approaches like linear regression, Q-Learning, KNN, and regression
trees and how to apply them to actual stock trading situations.
